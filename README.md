# Project

The project features clean design react slider component, developed using React, Vite, and TypeScript, without any additional external libraries (for the slider implementation).

It features a mock data layer using MSW (Mock Service Worker), ability to handle a changing number of items and supports button and keyboard controls, as well as touch gestures. I plan to add an additional caching mechanism in order to handle larger number of items.

## Development

- Install all dependencies > npm install
- Setup MSW > npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
- Run dev mode > npm run dev
