# Project

The project features a clean design react slider component, developed using React, Vite, and TypeScript, without any additional external libraries (for the slider implementation).

It features a mock data layer using MSW (Mock Service Worker), ability to handle a changing number of items and supports button and keyboard controls, as well as touch gestures. It is planned to have an additional caching mechanism in order to get better perfoemance when dealing with larger number of items.
